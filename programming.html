    <h2 id="prointro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Due to its communal and interactive structure, library programming is a fantastic way to introduce CritLib and EDI concepts into the library space. Library programs aim to connect with community members of every age, gender, race, class, and background, and almost any library program can promote EDI to patrons.</p>
        <p>This toolkit will provide an in-depth description of how video games can be used as CritLib programming, and in the 'Further Resources' section other ideas for integrating EDI into new or existing programs with be discussed. Use the buttons on the left side of this page to go directly to any section.</p>
    <h2 id="provideo">Video Games as Programming</h2>
        <p>The traditional view of literacy is connected to reading and writing, often thought of as "a continuum of learning and proficiency in reading, writing and using numbers throughout life," (UNESCO, 2024). In our increasingly digitized world, digital skills have become a critical part of literacy as well (UNESCO, 2024). Digital literacy refers to "the digital competences children and adults may acquire through the use of digital technologies," (van Laar et al. 2017, cited in Erstad, 2020, p. 21), and is now as relevent as learning to read, write and count in most of our global society.</p>
        <p>Digital literacy can be gained through most interactions with technology, including computers, phones, tablets and game consoles. Video games are unique within digital literacy because they allow users to gain digital skills in an engaging and fun way. A classic example of this is Microsoft Minesweeper, a game that came with classic PCs and was "a way of teaching people basic mouse controls in an era where most computing had been text-based," (Cobbett, 2009). Today's video games teach these and more complex digital skills relevent to modern technologies, and many have expanded to include traditional literacy skills as well. Examples include time and money-management games that teach basic math skills, and interactive story games that include text-based storylines similar to books.</p>
        <p>Diversity is growing in video games, meaning that they are also a great addition to library programs hoping to promote EDI. Not only does hosting video game programs featuring diverse characters celebrate EDI, but the programs are also a gathering space for diverse patrons that share a common interest. While stereotypes around video games do exist, they are not just for reclusive white men and children; gaming and game design are for everyone!</p>
    <h3>Examples of Gaming Programs</h3>
            <p class="image">
                <img src="../ocl_gaming_poster.png">
                <img src="../mpl_gaming_poster.png">
                <img src="../ppl_gaming_poster.png"></p>
            <p>The above images are promotional gaming club posters from three different library systems: Oxford County Library (2024) <i>(left)</i>,  Monrovia Public Library (2023) <i>(centre)</i> and Pembroke Public Library (2024) <i>(right)</i>. These posters demonstrate that there are many ways of approaching video game programming in the library. Here are some examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Combine video games with traditional board and card games:</b> this is a common method of gaming program developement also used in Oxford County Library's Level Up! Gaming Club (2024). It allows for more patrons to attend the program and play games while waiting for their turn on a game console, which is useful for systems with limited gaming consoles and other resources.</li>
                    <li><b>Gaming clubs can be for any age:</b> as seen in the above posters, different libraries provide video game clubs for different age groups, from children and teens to adults. </li>
                    <li><b>Blend video games with simple coding:</b> this is a great way to introduce patrons to coding and game design through gaming. Several children's games are available to purchase that use coding mechanics to progress the game.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>There are several ways to approach video game programming in libraries, depending on the time and space available. One of the most common methods is scheduled programming; this involves access to video game programming being limited to a particular date and time (Abrams &amp; Van Eck, 2021, p. 230). Abrams &amp; Van Eck (2021) argue that though this type of programming structure is quite standard and used for most types of library programming, it may not be ideal for the "ongoing, iterative nature of free play" that promotes the development of gaming literacies (p. 230-1). I would argue that a non-ideal program is better than no program; if time and space constraints mean all you can offer to patrons is scheduled access to video games in the library, then it is still worth doing for the people who attend!</p>
        <h3>Barriers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Resource Limitations:</b> these include a lack of time, funding and space, as well as limited digital technologies (including video games, computers, consoles, and internet connection) (Abrams &amp; Van Eck, 2021, p. 228-9)</li>
                <li><b>Staff Misconceptions:</b> a lack of knowledge about or understanding of video games and their impact on youth (including ideas that video games cause violent or roudy behaviour); underestimating the value of video games on youth literacy and cultural development (Abrams &amp; Van Eck, 2021, p. 229)</li>
            </ul>
            
    <h2 id="prores">Further Resources</h2>
        <p>Check out the American Library Association's <a href="https://games.ala.org/">Games &amp; Gaming Round Table</a> for some ideas of how to integrate phsyical and digital games into the library space.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Craftivities:</b> some library systems popularized take-home crafts during the pandemic, and they are a great way to connect with young patrons both inside and outside of the library. They can also be used to highlight diverse holidays, such as rainbow crafts during Pride month or paper lanterns during Chinese New Year or Diwali. It's easy to include a craft in many children's programs or host an online program/event where children can share their crafts online.</li>
        <li><b>Book Clubs:</b> highlight diverse and Own Voices books during library-hosted book clubs. These can be relevent to an event or time of year, but don't limit yourself to just these times.</li>
        <li><b>Fibre Arts:</b> encourage patrons to learn about different styles of fibre arts from around the world. Provide books and magazines or, if you have the time and interest, learn some new skills yourself and demonstrate them during the program. Check out <a href="https://sarazenanyin.com/types-of-fiber-arts/">this article by Sarazen An Yin</a> for ideas!</li>
