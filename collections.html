    <h2 id="colintro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The goal of critical collections management can be summarized by the vision statement of nonprofit organization We Need Diverse Books (WNDB): "[a] world where everyone can find themselves in the pages of a book," (n.d.). Library staff should strive to diversify their collections through the inclusion of BIPOC, LGBTQ+, Disabled, Own Voices and Feminist books, characters, and authors. In addition, library staff should also work towards deconstrucion of traditional collection standards through the inclusion and promotion of unconventional formats. This page will discuss in-depth two types of collections libraries should ensure are available to patrons due to their celebration of diverse perspectives and/or unique and often underrepresented formats. The Further Resources section will also briefly highlight some other unique collections topics that may be of interest to collections librarians as well.</p>
        
    <h2 id="coltrans">Translated &amp; Untranslated Works</h2>
        <p class="quote">"I love finding untranslated words from other languages in books written in English. It’s a beautiful reminder that the world is so much bigger than one language," - Sackton, 2022</p>
        
        <p>Translated works are a great opportunity to expose a community to ideas and traditions from other cultures around the world. Similarly, English-language works that also include untranslated words and phrases can help to break down Eurocentric beliefs. Most translated and untranslated books are also Own Voices works, with authors writing about their own culture or a fictional culture inspired by their lived experiences. Because of this, librarians and library staff should strive to include as many translated and untranslated books in their collections as possible, to provide patrons with multiple worldviews and to promote EDI and diverse authors.</p>
        
        <p>Translated works can also bring social justice issues to a global audience, as is discussed in the Decolonizing Through Critical Librarianship blog curated by Cambridge University librarians (2023). The post titled 'Caste in the Library: On Representation', refers to how "English-language publishing made this conversation more visible," (Decolonizing Critical Librarianship, 2023), speaking specifically about books on caste originally written in languages such as Tamil, Hindi and Marathi, and later translated into English by various publishing houses (Decolonizing Critical Librarianship, 2023). This is an extension of the value of Own Voices writing; readers are gifted a different worldview from their own, but are also presented with social justice issues that may have not occured to them before. As part of a globalized society, we all should be more aware of the troubles of humankind around the world and support the people affected by them within and outside of our communities.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, translated works are not without barriers to access. As stated by Elizabeth Bird, "[g]etting a quality translation in the first place is difficult, since the average U.S. press rarely has employees on staff with the knowledge and ability to vet literature in other languages," (2017). Because there are such limits to even getting a translated work published, libraries should be supporting the publishing companies that do publish them by buying new and critically acclaimed translated books. Libraries should also support the authors and translators of these books through sales, as well as by inviting them as guest speakers. All these acts can encourage writers and publishers to keep creating translated works, and can further bring EDI and diverse perspectives into the library space.</p>

    <h2 id="colgraph">Graphic Novels &amp; Comics</h2>
        <p>Comics and graphic novels are a non-traditional format of writing that have ties to many forms of cultural expression. Some examples include the Japanese manga, Korean manhwa, and French bandes dessinées. Including cultural works such as these in a library collection is an excellent way of supporting and promoting EDI and Own Voices works to patrons. Indigenous cultures also have traditions based around visual imagery that blends well with the medium of comics. Comic book store owner Lee Francis IV explains that to him, "this visual storytelling that harks back to our own stories and petroglyphs — rock art — ties it back to our ancestors," (Associated Press, 2020).</p>
        
        <p>Despite the cultural traditions of many forms of comics and other image-based storytelling formats, many people within and outside of the library continue to underestimate or outright dismiss their importance and relevence in society. One suggestion that may begin to break down this stigma is to stop separating comics and graphic novels from other books based on their format. People generally judge comics and graphic novels as one single format without realizing that this format encompasses all genres that exist in books; therefore, integrating image-based works with text-based works could help break down the stigma around format and help people focus on genre instead. It could also be useful to promote graphic novels in library book displays or online book displays, or to host book clubs that include graphic novels in their reading lists.</p>
