            <p>Welcome to the Practical CritLib Toolkit! This site is meant to provide librarians and library staff with information and suggestions on how critical librarianship can be integrated into the public library space. Focus has been placed on three categories of librarianship: cataloguing, collections, and programming. Browse any pages that are interesting or relevent to you!</p>
        <h2 id="homecritlib">What is Critical Librarianship?</h2>
            <p>Critical librarianship, or CritLib, "places librarianship within a critical theorist framework that is epistemological, self-reflective, and activist in nature," (Garcia, 2015), and "seeks to be transformative, empowering, and a direct challenge to power and privilege," (Garcia, 2015). CritLib focuses on promoting social justice in the library space, including within physical and digital spaces as well as in library materials and events. Examples may include, but are not limited to, challenging traditional library practices that do not support social justice and Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI), promoting EDI through diverse collection development and programming, and developing library services based on the needs and desires of the community.</p>
        <h2 id="homeaction">What Can I Do?</h2>
            <p>One of the best ways to learn about CritLib and how to use it in your library is to listen to the voices of other librarians and library staff. This toolkit is a great place to start, but don't stop there; follow the links on this site to articles and research papers, and do your own research as well! See what other libraries are already doing to apply CritLib to their own workplaces. Learn what I and others think and decide what will work best for your library and the community it serves. Get creative!</p>
            <p>If you have strong opinions on CritLib, positive or negative, feel free to contact me via email! I would love to hear more thoughts and experiences from library staff and patrons alike, so I can continue to develop my own ideas about CritLib.
