        <h2 id="catprob">The Problem with DDC</h2>
            <p class="quote">"the proper study of library classification is the universe of knowledge itself" - Miksa, 1998, p. 74</p>
        
            <p>Every library professional knows of the Dewey Decimal Classification, and more than likely you've worked closely with it - especially if you've worked in a public library system before. For anyone new to LIS, the DDC is a commonly used system for organizing a library collection by subject. It was first published by Melville Dewey, an American librarian, in 1876, and divides all human knowledge into tidy groups and subgroups of ten (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2024).</p>
        
            <p>The DDC is currently on its 23rd edition, first published in 2011, and a digital version called WebDewey is also available to subscribers. One of the greatest benefits to using WebDewey is that "metadata managers have the most up-to-date DDC numbers available that are based on an array of continually evolving topics and languages," (OCLC, n.d.), meaning that the virtual version of the classification system can be regularly updated, unlike its phsyical counterpart.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the ability of WebDewey to be continually updated, many of the groups within the DDC itself remain based in a white, male, Christian, Anglo, and Euro-centric worldview. This worldview is most apparent within the 200s of the DDC, designated for world religions; the majority of the 200s (230s-280s) is designated for Christianty (OCLC, 2024a), and all other religions are relegated to the 290s, unfortunately summarized under the title, "Other Religions," (OCLC, 2024a). Similar Eurocentric biases also exist in the 400s (Languages) and 800s (Literature) (OCLC, 2024b, 2024c), where Western culture is prioritized over all others. It is clear that the DDC is saturated in the outdated worldview of its 19th century creator, so what can we as 21st century librarians and library staff do to modernize our current cataloguing systems?</p>
        <h2 id="catlct">Library Classification Theory</h2>
            <p>The DDC was created in a time and place in which "its purpose was intertwined with the educational and cultural objectives of the modern library movement" (Miksa, 1998, p. 76). The goal of classification was to create a single system that could be used to organize the entire universe of knowledge that ever did or will exist (Miksa, 1998, p. 74).</p>
            
            <p>Conversely, the post-modern, 20th century view of classification is that there does not exist one perfect classification system for the universe of knowledge (Miksa, 1998, p. 86). Drabinski uses a Queer lens to discuss "the contingency of these apparently stable structures,"(2013, p. 105), asserting that classification should categorize information to make it easier to locate for patrons, but that it should also be made clear to patrons that these categories are not universal or permenent (p. 105). While cataloguing and organizing information is important to library work, it should be made clear to library staff and patrons alike that cataloguing is more of an interpretive artform than a scientific practice.</p>  
        
        <p>Both Drabinski and Miksa highlight the concept of localizing cataloguing systems. While Miksa (1998) discusses it in terms of personal online libraries for patrons (p. 88), Drabinski (2013) describes " developing alternative local classification and cataloging systems built out of alternative thesauri" (p. 106) so that they can be more easily explored and contemplated by users. "Most of the problems associated with alternative arrangements," Miksa (1998) explains, "have arisen because using them is so labor intensive," (p. 88). It takes a lot of time, money, and labor to transition from a currently used system like DDC to a new system, and even more so if developing a new local system entirely. However, there is a great cultural benefit to personalizing a cataloguing system to suit a community. For instance, it can be of great value for a community with a large Muslim population to not have works on their religious practices relegated to the 'Other Religions' section of a library.</p>
        <p>Having diverse populations within a community equitably acknowledged within a library catalogue can demonstrate a committment to EDI and improve a library's relationship to its diverse patronage.</p>
                
        <h2 id="catudc">Universal Decimal Classification</h2>
            <p>The American Library Association (ALA) libguide on classification (2022) suggests three cataloguing systems for libraries: Library of Congress Classification (LCC), Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), and the lesser-known Universal Decimal Classification (UDC). Though no classification system is entirely neutral, UDC may be of interest to library professionals looking to break away from more biased American systems without having to create an entirely new local system. UDC is similar in structure to DDC, making use of the same decimal format, but was intended to be multilingual (ALA, 2022) and has designed its organizational structure and categories based on this intention. As the UDC was developed in Belgium (ALA, 2022), it also lacks the America-centric biases of the DDC and LCC. Check out <a href="https://udcc.org/">https://udcc.org/</a> to learn more or to subscribe to the UDC's online classification system. </p>
        
        <h2 id="catdigi">Digital Cataloguing</h2> 
            <p>The ALA defines the OPAC, or library catalogue, as something which "allows users to search the library's collections using a web-based user interface," (2016). These catalogues often show online users which physical works are available in the library, as well as displaying those that can be accessed online via the library website or an app. </p>
        
            <p>As librarians and library staff, we are often focused on the OPAC from a patron perspective; we are helping patrons search for things or searching ourselves. However, CritLib in digital classification can be extended to the development of OPACs as well. In a 2022 interview, Diego Pino Navarro describes current OPAC software as "extremely complex, driven by technology instead of user needs," (Ziegler, p. 2). In designing his open source library software, Navarro states, "the only way we can give people freedom in cataloging and classification is if we remove the hard coded decisions that software developers were making in the system," (Ziegler, 2022, p. 3). In the same way cataloguing systems can help users more easily interact with information, cataloguing software can make the digital cataloguing process easier for library staff. </p>
        
            <p>Using cataloguing software that can be personalized based on libaray and community preferences can also benefit EDI. Personalized software can have a similar affect to personalized cataloguing systems in a physical library, by localizing information organization to the benefit of the community. As Navarro says, "[y]ou're not putting things into a repository because you believe repository software is the best. You're actually putting them in because you want to share these valuable assets and stories with other people," (Ziegler, 2022, p. 3-4). The purpose of cataloguing is to share information with patrons in the easiest way; just as our work is user-focused, we as librarians and staff should seek a digital cataloguing system that focuses on the needs of its users (the library) over profit and standardization.</p>
